## Specifications
**1. How to use and run the screen reader?**
- Developers need to add `main.js` as a script in the head of their HTML document.
- Users can then click the `Start Reading` button to have the screen reader read
the page from top to bottom.
- Users can click the `Stop Reading` button to have the screen reader stop reading
at any point.
- Users can press the left arrow key on their keyboard to have the screen reader go back
and reread the previous line.
- Users can press the right arrow key on their keyboard to have the screen reader skip
forward to the next line.
